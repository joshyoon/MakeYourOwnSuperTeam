# MakeYourOwnSuperTeam

This project is my first official project that combines my study of HTML/CSS/Javascript with my passion for basketball.  Based off a popular instagram game that challenges user to create their own NBA super team that can beat the Golden State Warriors who signed past NBA MVP Kevin Durant following a record-setting 73-9 season.  Each player is given a dollar value and the challenge is that each User must stay under a budet of $15.  After User super team is created, I sum total individual off. and def. rating to generate a percent chance of winning.  Hope any lover of the NBA can enjoy.
